# Internet & Browser Intelligence Layer

## Purpose
This AI layer provides advanced internet connectivity, search, and browsing intelligence.
It integrates external data, web feeds, APIs, and online resources directly into the system,
while maintaining privacy, speed, and adaptive learning.

It functions as the gateway between internal AI systems and external information sources.
