# Digital Architecture
## Professional Digital Systems Core v1.0

### Role
This document defines the digital architecture layer derived directly from
`architecture-core.md`.

All software systems, AI engines, platforms, tools, media systems, games,
and automated designers operate within this layer.

This is a production-grade architecture, not a prototype.

---

## Scope of Digital Architecture

This layer governs:

- Artificial Intelligence Systems
- Software Platforms
- Media Engines (Video, Music, Streaming)
- Game Engines and Interactive Systems
- Automated Design Systems
- Data, Logic, and Processing Pipelines

No digital system exists outside this architecture.

## Core Digital Principles

1. **Modular Intelligence**
   - Every system is composed of independent, swappable modules.
   - Modules communicate through defined interfaces only.

2. **Library-First Design**
   - All intelligence is packaged as reusable libraries.
   - No monolithic codebases.

3. **AI-as-Infrastructure**
   - AI is treated as infrastructure, not a feature.
   - Systems assume AI presence by default.

4. **Professional-Grade Standards**
   - Versioned
   - Testable
   - Auditable
   - Scalable
   - Production-safe

### 2. AI Library Layer
- Model libraries
- Skill libraries
- Domain-specific intelligence modules
- Designers-as-AI modules

### 3. Platform Layer
- Video platforms
- Music platforms
- Gaming platforms
- App ecosystems
- Creator studios

### 4. Experience Layer

## Automated Designers (Native)

Digital Architecture natively supports AI Designers:

- Software Designer AI
- Media Designer AI
- Game Designer AI
- Architecture Designer AI
- Engineering Designer AI
- Graphics & Visual Designer AI

Designers generate **systems**, not mockups.

---

## Evolution Model

- New digital systems extend existing layers.
- No system bypasses architecture rules.
- Experimental systems remain sandboxed until validated.

---

## Security & Stability

- Isolation by design
- Controlled execution boundaries
- Upgrade paths without breaking dependencies

---

## Status
Active • Professional Grade • Version 1.0
