# AI Lab Core

## Overview
This module represents the central AI experimentation and development hub for Mintage. It manages AI model training, simulations, and intelligent system testing.

## Components
1. **Model Trainer** – Trains AI models across multiple domains (media, gaming, design, robotics).
2. **Simulation Engine** – Runs virtual tests and scenario simulations for new AI behaviors.
3. **Research Database** – Stores datasets, experimental results, and AI performance logs.
4. **Collaboration Layer** – Allows multiple AI designers and modules to interact and improve collectively.

## Integration
Directly connects to all Mintage AI designers: architecture, food, video, gaming, and virtual assistants.
