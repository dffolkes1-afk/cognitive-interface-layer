# Learning AI / OS Layer

## Core Objective
Establish an adaptive AI learning layer functioning at the OS level. Supports multi-subject specialization or a unified learning AI.

## Features
- Adaptive learning engine: adjusts to user progress.
- Multi-subject AI: can specialize or unify across subjects.
- Visual and video outputs for learning reinforcement.
- Language-agnostic support for global accessibility.
- Scheduling system for personalized learning sessions.
- Integration with other AI layers (media, design, executive).

## Input
- Textbooks, scripts, notes.
- Visual references: diagrams, videos, images.
- Audio: lectures, music, and voice notes.

## Output
- Personalized learning sessions.
- Visual aids, animations, and video tutorials.
- Adaptive audio and sound-assisted learning cues.
# Learning AI / OS Layer

## Core Objective
Establish a self-adaptive Learning AI that functions as an operating-system-level intelligence, capable of teaching, organizing, and evolving knowledge across all domains.

## Capabilities
- Personalized learning paths per user
- Multi-language education and translation
- Visual, audio, and simulation-based learning
- Time-scheduled study programs
- Skill progression tracking and certification logic

## Media Integration
- Auto-generates diagrams, videos, and interactive lessons
- Works with Media Engine for visual cognition
- Supports real-time tutoring and replayable sessions

## System Role
- Acts as the intelligence backbone for all educational functions
- Interfaces with Designer AIs to teach design, engineering, and creativity
- Feeds insights to Boss AI for performance analytics
