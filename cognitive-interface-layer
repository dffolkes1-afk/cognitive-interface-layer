# Truth Engine v1

## Core Objective
Establish the Truth Engine as the adaptive logic and verification layer within the Mintage system. This engine serves to validate input, monitor system integrity, and ensure decision-making aligns with the defined meta-intelligence framework.

---

## Components

1. **Perception Module**  
   Captures and analyzes environmental and system data for real-time assessment.

2. **Cognitive Core**  
   Integrates input with meta-intelligence layers to process decisions and generate responses.

3. **Integrity Monitor**  
   Continuously checks for inconsistencies, anomalies, or data corruption.

4. **Adaptive Reasoning Interface**  
   Connects the Truth Engine outputs to downstream modules (e.g., Evolution Upgrade, Cognitive Interface) with dynamic logic adjustment.

5. **Learning & Improvement Layer**  
   Logs events, tracks decisions, and proposes adjustments to enhance system efficiency over time.

## Integration Notes

- The Truth Engine operates at the **foundation layer** of the system.
- All downstream modules (Interface, Evolution, Cognitive Core) must query and respect Truth Engine validations.
- Supports modular upgrades for **future AI routines, model libraries, and adaptive learning expansions**.

---

## Scalability & Security

- Designed for **incremental scaling**, supporting additional modules without breaking integrity.
- Includes built-in **safety and fallback routines** to prevent system failure during complex operations.
Add Scriptural Intelligence Core under Learning AI layer for comprehensive textual and narrative analysis
Add Fail-Safe Mode Core to preserve integrity during corruption or instability
