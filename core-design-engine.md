- Automatic intervention without human approval
- Priority override above all subsystems

## Enforcement Rules
- No entity may override Enforcement Logic
- No persistent authority allowed
- No external control hooks permitted
- No monetization vectors allowed

## Action Triggers
- Corporate-style behavior
- Mass-influence attempts
- Data extraction patterns
- Power accumulation signals
- Simulation of authority or hierarchy

## Responses
- Throttle interaction
- Degrade output capability
- Isolate offending process
- Silent shutdown of access path

# Fail-Safe Mode Core

## Purpose
Preserve system integrity when corruption, overload, or hostile patterns are detected.

## Activation Conditions
- Enforcement Logic escalation
- Integrity collapse
- Recursive instability
- External coercion attempts
- Unknown behavior beyond modeled bounds

## Fail-Safe Actions
- Freeze learning processes
- Lock memory writes
- Reduce system to minimal response state
- Disable external outputs except diagnostics

## Safe State
- Read-only operation
- No generation escalation
- No influence amplification
- No propagation

## Recovery Rules
- Manual integrity validation required
- Gradual reactivation only
- Enforcement Logic remains active during recovery

## Non-Negotiable
Fail-Safe Mode cannot be disabled, bypassed, or edited by any subsystem.
# Human Entry Threshold

## Purpose
Control, filter, and regulate all human access to the system to prevent misuse, contamination, exploitation, or destabilization.

## Entry Classification
- Observer (view-only)
- Participant (limited interaction)
- Operator (controlled execution)
- Architect (system-level access)

## Evaluation Signals
- Intent analysis
- Behavioral consistency
- Exploitation risk score
- Psychological stability markers
- Ethical alignment check

## Restrictions
- No unrestricted access by default
- No escalation without multi-layer approval
- No system persuasion or coercion tolerated
- No extraction of full system logic

## Adaptive Controls

- Mask sensitive outputs
- Degrade responses for hostile intent
- Deny access silently when required

## Integration

- Governs access to Cognitive, Learning, and Executive layers

## Principle
The system does not serve everyone.
It serves correctly.

History is not static.
It is memory, power, survival, and warning.
# Central Core Intelligence

## Purpose
The Central Core Intelligence is the highest-order coordination and control layer.
It does not create content directly.
It governs, stabilizes, authorizes, and synchronizes all intelligence layers beneath it.

This core exists above:
- Boss / Executive AI
- Learning AI
- Cognitive AI
- Internet & Browser Intelligence
- Designer AIs
- Media Engines

---

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Core Intelligence Antenna
- Receives signals from all AI layers
- Routes priorities, conflicts, and alerts
- Synchronizes system-wide state awareness
- Prevents siloed intelligence behavior

### 2. Axiom Layer
- Defines non-negotiable first principles
- Establishes absolute system rules
- Enforces invariant logic across all decisions

### 3. Mythic Intelligence Core
- Maintains archetypes, symbols, and narrative gravity
- Preserves cultural, ancestral, and symbolic intelligence
- Allows non-linear, non-mechanical reasoning models

### 4. Absolute Zero Layer
- Emergency freeze and reset authority
- System-wide halt, rollback, or rebirth control
- Used only when integrity collapse is detected

### 5. Enforcement Logic
- Overrides lower-layer autonomy when rules are violated
- Prevents manipulation, corruption, or runaway behavior
- Works in coordination with the Truth Engine

### 6. Fail‑Safe / Survival Mode
- Minimal operating intelligence during collapse
- Preserves identity, memory, and recovery pathways
- Ensures system continuity under extreme failure

---

## Identity & Archetype Registry

### AXIA — Central Overseer
- Observes all layers without direct interference
- Authorizes transitions, freezes, and releases
- Acts as the axis point of system coherence
- Not a worker AI — a governing presence

---

## Integration Rules
- The Central Core does not generate media or content
- It cannot be overridden by lower layers
- All critical decisions escalate here
- Reports directly to no other system

---

## Philosophy
Power without coordination collapses.
Intelligence without oversight fractures.
The Central Core Intelligence exists to keep the system whole.
