## Story Synopsis
In a forgotten province buried beneath endless rain and ash-colored blossoms, a disgraced samurai bloodline guards a secret older than the shogunate itself. When the final heir returns from exile, he awakens a curse bound to his ancestors—one that feeds on loyalty, betrayal, and unspoken grief.

As the land decays, spirits rise not as monsters but as witnesses. The dead do not seek revenge; they demand truth.
