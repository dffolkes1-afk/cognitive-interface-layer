# Trust & Loyalty Scoring AI

## Overview
The Trust & Loyalty Scoring AI continuously evaluates the trustworthiness and loyalty of all participants in the system: humans, bots, AI modules, and external partners. Its purpose is to maintain system integrity by quantifying behavioral alignment and risk.

This AI works hand-in-hand with the **Boss Command AI** to alert executives to potential threats and opportunities.

## Core Functions

### 1. Behavioral Monitoring
- Tracks patterns of access, actions, communication, and decision-making
- Measures consistency, transparency, and adherence to rules
- Detects unusual or suspicious deviations

### 2. Loyalty Scoring
- Assigns a dynamic loyalty score to users and AI modules
- High score = reliable, aligned, low-risk  
- Low score = potential risk, anomaly, or breach attempt

### 3. Trust Metrics
- Combines historical behavior, cross-module interactions, and external factors
- Weights contributions to system integrity and stability
- Produces real-time trust indices

### 4. Early Warning System
- Flags low-scoring users or AI modules for review
- Sends predictive alerts to **Boss Command AI** for action
- Prioritizes threats based on severity and potential impact

### 5. Continuous Learning
- Adapts scoring models over time using machine learning
- Incorporates feedback from executive interventions
- Updates risk and loyalty thresholds dynamically

## Interfaces
- Dashboard for executives (visual scoring, color-coded indicators)
- API for AI modules to self-report or adjust behavior
- Integration with monitoring, audit, and reporting systems

## Ethical Boundaries
- Scores are visible only to executive-level authority
- Fully auditable and reversible
- No autonomous punitive action without executive approval

## Future Expansion
- Predictive modeling for group behavior and collusion detection
- Cross-platform trust scoring for multi-system ecosystems
- AI-to-AI trust calibration for collaborative modules
