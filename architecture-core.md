# Architecture Core
## Unified Architecture Foundation v1.0

### Purpose
This document defines the single, authoritative architecture core for the entire system.
All platforms, AI designers, media systems, games, tools, and future technologies derive
from this core. Nothing exists outside of it.

This core is immutable in principle and extensible in practice.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - One architecture governs all layers.
   - No parallel or competing cores.

2. **Layered Expansion**
   - Systems grow by branching from this core.
   - New domains never rewrite the core.

3. **Non-Breaking Evolution**
   - Upgrades extend capabilities without breaking existing systems.
   - Backward compatibility is mandatory.

4. **AI-Native Design**
   - Every layer assumes AI participation by default.
   - Human and AI designers coexist within the same architecture.

## Architecture Levels (Derived Only)

All architecture levels below are children of this core:

- Digital Architecture (Software, AI, Platforms)
- Physical Architecture (Buildings, Engineering, Infrastructure)
- Virtual Architecture (Games, Simulations, Worlds)
- Hybrid Architecture (Smart Cities, Robotics, Cyber-Physical Systems)

No level operates independently.

---

## Control Model

- Core = Defines rules
- Levels = Apply rules
- Designers = Execute within rules
- Systems = Manifest results

---

## Governance

- Changes to this core require deliberate versioning.
- Experimental ideas live in derived layers, not here.
- Stability of the ecosystem depends on this file.

---

## Status
Active • Locked Core • Version 1.0
