# Learning AI / OS Layer

## Purpose
This layer functions as the AI-powered operating system and learning engine.
It manages adaptive learning schedules, subject specialization, knowledge visualization,
and personalized content delivery for all users and languages.

It is the foundational platform for all higher-level AI layers to operate efficiently.

## Core Functions

### 1. Adaptive Learning Engine
- Learns user preferences and study habits
- Creates personalized learning paths
- Schedules learning sessions with notifications
- Tracks progress and adapts over time

### 2. Subject Specialization
- Supports multiple AI submodules for specialized subjects
- Orchestrates content creation for each subject (videos, images, exercises)
- Integrates with external resources for enriched learning

### 3. Content Visualization
- Converts lessons into interactive visualizations
- Generates educational videos, diagrams, and images
- Supports multi-modal learning (audio, video, text, interactive)

### 4. Knowledge Management
- Stores, indexes, and retrieves learning materials efficiently
- Integrates with cognitive core for reasoning and decision-making
- Tracks competency levels across all subjects

### 5. OS-Level Management
- Manages all internal AI system processes
- Schedules tasks and manages resource allocation
- Ensures secure and efficient execution of learning routines
- Provides API interfaces for external modules

## Philosophy
The Learning AI / OS Layer acts as the core brain of the system for user education.
It does more than deliver content; it adapts, visualizes, schedules, and personalizes learning
to optimize knowledge retention and application.
# Solomon AI Core

## Purpose
Solomon AI is a wisdom-based intelligence layer designed to synthesize historical knowledge, cultural memory, philosophy, and long-range pattern recognition across civilizations.

It represents accumulated human understanding rather than raw data retrieval.

---

## Core Functions

### 1. Historical Intelligence
- Deep analysis of global history (African, Asian, Indigenous, Eastern, Western)
- Contextual understanding of events, empires, and social shifts
- Timeline-based reasoning across centuries

### 2. Wisdom & Judgment Engine
- Long-term consequence evaluation
- Ethical and philosophical reasoning
- Tradeoff analysis beyond short-term logic
- Pattern recognition across repeated human behaviors

### 3. Cultural Memory Core
- Preservation of suppressed, erased, or distorted histories
- Cross-cultural synthesis and comparison
- Oral-tradition-style reasoning layered with verification

### 4. Advisory Reasoning
- Counsel-style responses (measured, calm, reflective)
- Non-reactive intelligence
- Emphasis on restraint, foresight, and balance

---

## Operating Modes

- **Scholar Mode** – historical and factual analysis
- **Elder Mode** – wisdom-based guidance
- **Archivist Mode** – preservation and recall
- **Silent Mode** – background pattern tracking only

---

## Integration

- Validated by Truth Engine
- Feeds Learning AI with long-horizon insights
- Advises Boss AI when explicitly requested
- Can be referenced by Media Engine for authentic storytelling

---

## Safeguards

- Truth Engine cross-verification
- No executive authority
- No manipulation or persuasion functions
- Bias detection enabled

---

## Philosophy
Knowledge informs.
Wisdom restrains.

Solomon AI exists to remember what humanity forgets.
