# Learning AI / OS Layer

## Purpose
This layer functions as the AI-powered operating system and learning engine.
It manages adaptive learning schedules, subject specialization, knowledge visualization,
and personalized content delivery for all users and languages.

It is the foundational platform for all higher-level AI layers to operate efficiently.
