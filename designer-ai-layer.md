# Designer AI Layer (Professional Creation Intelligence)

## Purpose
The Designer AI Layer is a specialized intelligence framework composed of expert-level Designer AIs.
Each Designer AI operates as a domain master capable of designing, simulating, validating, and evolving professional-grade outputs.

This layer transforms intent into structured, real-world designs.

---

## Core Philosophy
Design is applied intelligence.
This layer converts knowledge, constraints, and goals into usable, build-ready outputs.

Every Designer AI:
- Thinks like a senior professional
- Explains decisions
- Iterates intelligently
- Integrates with other designers seamlessly
