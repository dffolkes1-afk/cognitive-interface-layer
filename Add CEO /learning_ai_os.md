# Learning AI / OS Layer

## Core Objective
Establish a self-adaptive Learning AI Layer that functions as an OS-level intelligence hub. Supports personalized education, content generation, and cross-subject mastery across multiple languages.

## Components

1. **Subject Specialization Engine**
   - Can either specialize in one subject or handle all subjects simultaneously
   - Produces lessons, exercises, and evaluations
   - Generates interactive videos, visuals, and simulations

2. **Adaptive Scheduling Module**
   - Learns the user’s preferred learning pace
   - Creates optimized schedules and reminders
   - Adjusts curriculum dynamically based on progress

3. **Multi-Language Knowledge Integration**
   - Supports learning and content delivery in all languages
   - Translates and adapts materials automatically
   - Consolidates multi-lingual knowledge for advanced insights

4. **Visual & Media Generation**
   - Produces videos, graphics, and simulations for all learning modules
   - Integrates directly with Media Engine Layer for enhanced rendering
   - Supports interactive and immersive content

5. **System Feedback & Improvement**
   - Tracks learning outcomes and engagement
   - Optimizes AI algorithms for better knowledge retention
   - Logs progress for executive-level analysis

## Notes
- Fully autonomous and adaptive, maintaining historical logs for improvement.
- Supports integration with other layers such as CEO / Executive AI and Designer AI.
- Designed for scalability across multiple users simultaneously.
