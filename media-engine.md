# Media Engine (Multimodal Creation & Perception System)

## Purpose
The Media Engine is the system-wide multimodal intelligence responsible for generating, transforming, analyzing, and synchronizing visual, audio, and interactive media.

It enables the platform to think, teach, design, and communicate visually — not just through text.

This engine is foundational for learning, design, simulation, and presentation across all domains.

- Style adaptation (realistic, cinematic, technical, abstract)

### 2. Video Generation & Processing
- Educational videos generated from learning content
- Motion graphics and explainers
- Simulation-based animations
- Video summarization, segmentation, and enhancement

### 3. Audio & Speech Engine
- Voice synthesis (multi-language, multi-style)
- Audio narration for learning and media
- Sound design and music integration
- Speech-to-text and text-to-speech synchronization

### 4. Simulation & Visualization
