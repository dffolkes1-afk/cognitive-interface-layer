# Media Engine (Multimodal Creation & Perception System)

## Purpose
The Media Engine is the system-wide multimodal intelligence responsible for generating, transforming, analyzing, and synchronizing visual, audio, and interactive media.

It enables the platform to think, teach, design, and communicate visually — not just through text.

This engine is foundational for learning, design, simulation, and presentation across all domains.

- Cultural lineage adaptation (Japanese, African, Caribbean, Indian, Chinese, Middle Eastern)
- Dialogue generation with emotional subtext

#### 2. AI Voice & Tone Recognition
- Detects emotional intensity and scene mood
- Supports Caribbean, Black American, African, Asian, and global vocal tones
- Aligns dialogue delivery with emotional weight
- Syncs voice tone with music and scene pacing

#### 3. AI Music & Sound Design Layer
- Generates original cinematic scores per scene
- Adaptive background harmony and tension build-up
- Cultural instrument integration (taiko, drums, strings, chants)
- Ambient sound design (wind, breath, silence, violence, chaos)
- Emotional crescendo and decay control

---

### Input
- Story concepts or folklore
- Cultural or lineage selection
- Emotional intensity level
- Visual and sonic mood guidance

### Output
